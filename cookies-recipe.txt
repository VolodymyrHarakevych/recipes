Ingredients

    50g butter
    Butter

    , plus a little for greasing
    2 tbsp maple syrup
    1 dessert apple
    Apples

    , unpeeled and coarsely grated (you need 85g)
    1 tsp cinnamon
    Cinnamon

    50g raisins
    50g porridge oats
    50g spelt flour
    40g unblanched hazelnuts, cut into chunky slices
    1 egg
    Eggs

Method

    Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly grease a non-stick baking tray (or line a normal baking tray with baking parchment). Tip the butter and syrup into a small non-stick pan and melt together, then add the apple and cook, stirring, over a medium heat until it softens, about 6-7 mins. Stir in the cinnamon and raisins.

    Mix the oats, spelt flour, and hazelnuts in a bowl, pour in the apple mixture, then add the egg and beat everything together really well.

    Spoon onto the baking tray, well spaced apart to make 9 mounds, then gently press into discs. Bake for 18-20 mins until golden, then cool on a wire rack. Will keep for 3 days in an airtight container or 6 weeks in the freezer.
